# Seed-Mirror-dev

This is the foundational repo for the **Mirror system** — an AI-powered rhythm-based journaling, reflection, and self-coaching tool designed by Tucciford.

## 🔧 Repo Purpose
This codebase will house the core logic, UI, and system files for the Mirror app. It serves as the seedbed for all future Mirror agents and rhythm tracking systems.

## 📁 Folder Structure (to be added)
- `/src` — Mirror logic and reflection engine
- `/docs` — DevPackets and system notes
- `/public` — Front-facing landing page or UI
- `/scripts` — Install/setup logic and developer utilities

## 🧠 Philosophy
> Built with presence. Grown with rhythm.  
> Rooted in legacy, clarity, and adaptation.
