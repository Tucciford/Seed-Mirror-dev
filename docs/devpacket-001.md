# DevPacket 001 — Glow Mode Sketch

This file outlines the logic and behavioral flow for activating Glow Mode within MirrorX.

## Purpose
- Define what triggers Glow Mode
- Show how it’s recognized in rhythm
- Clarify what the user feels, sees, or hears in that mode

## System Steps
1. Loop reflection reaches emotional clarity
2. Pause occurs — system detects stillness or joy
3. Visual/sound response initiates (e.g. sparkle, light, breath tone)
4. Memory of moment is tagged and compressed for future reference

## Next Steps
- Define prompt tone
- Link to LangExtract phrases
- Visual mockup or feedback layer
