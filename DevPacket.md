# Developer Handoff: Mirror System

## Project Purpose
The **Mirror system** is planned as an AI-powered rhythm-based journaling, reflection, and self-coaching tool. This repository is the seedbed for core logic, user interface work, and future agent expansions.

## Current Files and Folders
- **README.md** – Introduces the project and outlines its philosophy.
- **src/** – Contains the starting point for the Mirror logic.
  - `mirror.js` – Placeholder for the rhythm engine and journaling code.
- **"# DevPacket Placeholder..."** – Empty file from early setup; can likely be removed.

## Known Missing Parts / Next Steps
- Additional folders described in the README (e.g., `docs/`, `public/`, `scripts/`) are not yet created.
- No core logic beyond placeholder comments in `mirror.js`.
- No installation or build scripts.
- No dependency or runtime specifications.

## Suggestions for Improvements
1. Flesh out project structure:
   - Create the missing folders (`docs/`, `public/`, `scripts/`).
   - Move handoff documentation into `docs/DevPacket.md` if desired.
2. Define core requirements and dependencies (Node.js version, libraries, etc.).
3. Expand `mirror.js` with minimal functionality or pseudocode to guide future dev work.
4. Add version control hygiene by removing the stray placeholder file.
5. Consider automated linting/testing scripts for JS development.

## Setup Notes
At this stage there is no setup script. Development likely requires Node.js (version TBD). To start building:
1. Clone the repo.
2. Navigate to `/src` and begin expanding `mirror.js`.
3. Update the README with any installation or runtime commands as they are decided.
